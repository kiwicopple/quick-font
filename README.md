# Quick, Font!

[Website](https://quickfont.xyz/)

## About

With Quick, Font! you can try out fonts on your own website without having to download and install the
font. It is similar to Google Fonts, except that I will never track your usage. All fonts
are served directly from Github (although the stylesheets are passed through a proxy to
ensure the correct Content-Type headers).

## Disclaimer

Many of these fonts are commercial - you have to pay if you want to use them beyond just
testing them out. I take no responsibility or liability if you use these in a commercial
project. I'm likely breaking some rules with this site, however I hope that the owners of
the fonts will see this as free promotion and advertising. If you are an owner of one of
these fonts and would like me to remove it, please open an issue.
  
I do not earn anything from this site, it is simply a tool to make developing and
prototyping much quicker.

## Contributing

I'd really welcome any contributions to this repo. Possible tasks include:

- Adding links to the original publishers for each font
- Fixing any CSS font files if they have errors
- Adding in new fonts
- Expanding current fonts (eg, add `woff2` if there are only `woff` files)
