        With <span class="is-italic is-bold">Quick, Font!</span>
        you can try out fonts on your own website without having to download and install the
        font. It is similar to Google Fonts, except that I will never track your usage. All fonts
        are served directly from Github (although the stylesheets are passed through a proxy to
        ensure the correct Content-Type headers).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also include non-free fonts here so that they can be trialled on your site. Please see the
        disclaimer!

        Many of these fonts are commercial - you have to pay if you want to use them beyond just
        testing them out. I take no responsibility or liability if you use these in a commercial
        project. I'm likely breaking some rules with this site, however I hope that the owners of
        the fonts will see this as free promotion and advertising. If you are an owner of one of
        these fonts and would like me to remove it, please
        <a href="https://github.com/kiwicopple/quick-font/issues">
          open an issue.
        </a>
        I do not earn anything from this site, it is simply a tool to make developing and
        prototyping much quicker.
